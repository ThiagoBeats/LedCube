# LedCube
Here is the code of a led cube 6x6x6

The main goal of this project is to create a interface between the 3D model with the real led cube. We create the graphical interface using JS, HTML, CSS and Python.
In the graphical interface, the user can turn on or off the leds and save the file. The python program will convert this to a language that the Arduino can read and command the respective led.
